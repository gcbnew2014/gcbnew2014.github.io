&lt;p&gt;JANUARY 7, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRESS STATEMENT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GCB responds to media publication&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our attention has been drawn to a news item being carried by the media about some funds that have been ''siphoned from the vaults of GCB''.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wish to assure our loyal customers and the general public that there is no cause for alarm as no funds have been ''siphoned from the vaults'' of the bank. Our customers' deposits are safe and the bank's vaults are very secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bank noticed some unusual withdrawals over the counter by customers in certain branches and took immediate steps to confirm the genuineness of these transactions. In the process, the Bank arrested the culprits the same day (and some the following day) who are going through due investigative process. The Bank proactively reported the matter to the Police and EOCO and is collaborating with them to carry out further investigations into the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To commence their investigations EOCO issued a letter to the Bank authorizing it to freeze the accounts on which the suspicious transactions had been carried out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this incident is unfortunate we are pleased with the speed with which the incident was detected and dealt with. We can also assure the general public and our customers that the Bank continues to invest in its Technology infrastructure to ensure that appropriate controls are in place to prevent or speedily detect any fraudulent activity as happened in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement in the media that the incident occurred with the connivance of the Bank's IT department has not been established. We would urge the media to collaborate with the law enforcement agencies in order not to jeopardise the investigative work being carried out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would like to take this opportunity to thank all our stakeholders, informants and the law enforcement agencies who worked with us to bring this issue under control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The facility is made up of two classrooms, a sleeping room, a kitchen&amp;nbsp;and bathroom and a place of convenience for the nursery and kindergarten unit of the Fawoman D/A School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The project was executed within a year as part of the Bank's corporate social responsibility project under its 60th anniversary celebrations.The Bank provided funds while the chiefs and people of Fawoman contributed communal labour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The construction of the school followed a May One, 2012, publication in the Daily Graphic on the plight of some 110 children aged between three and seven years studying under disaster-prone structures. The structure which accommodated KG1 and KG2 pupils of the school was constructed in 1987 by the Fawoman Community to serve as a workshop for technical subjects under the Junior High School project. Following the malfunctioning of this workshop, pupils of the Kindergarten who were then studying under palm branches were moved into the workshop structure. The dilapidated structure made teaching and learning very difficult as classes were disrupted by unfavorable weather conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Managing Director of GCB, Mr. Simon Dornoo, speaking at the commissioning of the project, announced plans by the Bank to partner the Non-Bank Financial Institutions (NBFIs) in the country to provide banking services, particularly to those in the rural communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;He said Ghana's banking landscape has been characterised by significant changes&amp;nbsp;over the last 15 to 20 years, driven by regulatory changes, technological advancement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;and competition.&quot;About 60 years ago, rural banks and micro finance companies were non-existent inGhana. Today we have over 300 of such NBFIs all over the country serving the local&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;communities.GCB is adapting to this irreversible trend by seeking opportunities to collaborate&amp;nbsp;with these NBFIs to bring banking services to the communities in a more cost-effective&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;way,&quot; Mr Dornoo said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Oheneba Kwabena Acheampongtia II, Abrenyasehene and Nana Boakye Ampofo I, Chief of Fawoman together with the Board Chairman of GCB, Dr Fritz Gockel, cut the tape to commission the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Nana Boakye Ampofo commended GCB for going to the aid of the community and appealed to the Bank to set up a scholarship scheme for the children of the area to attain higher education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;He also appealed to the Bank to set aside a fund for the maintenance of the new complex while considering the possibility of constructing a health post in the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ghana Commercial Bank Ltd. (GCB) has brought modern banking services to the Nanumba district and surrounding communities with the provision of ATM services at the new branch of the Bank in Bimbilla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GCB Bimbilla branch has been relocated to more spacious environs in view of the level of business being handled by the Bank in the district. From three teller points, the branch now has five and these are to be complemented by the services of the ATM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The branch together with the ATM, were commissioned by the District Chief Executive, Alhaji Mohammed Ibn Abass and Mr Kojo Addae-Mensah, Chief Operating Officer (COO) of GCB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiefs, the youth, traders, farmers, religious and community leaders thronged the new premises of the Bank to witness the ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elated DCE did not mince words when he commended the Bank for providing modern banking services in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He urged the Management of GCB to embark on a massive education program on the benefits of banking, the use of the ATM, internet banking and all the other electronic banking products for the mutual benefit of the people and the Bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alhaji Abass said the new premises of the Bank, befits the status of the district and the number of growing businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bimbilla is attractive for business due to the farming of yam and other food crops, and the location of a hospital, senior high school, College of Education and other institutions there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Addae-Mensah on his part urged residents of Bimbilla and adjoining towns and districts to take advantage of the presence of the ATM and other electronic banking services to ensure brisk business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;GCB has not only improved its systems and services and relocated to this magnificent building but has also brought modern banking facilities to your doorstep. Use them to your maximum benefit. Put your hard earned money in the Bank's safe custody and earn a good rate of return so that the value of your money can increase,&quot; he said.&lt;br /&gt;The COO explained that the relocation of the branch is in response to its growing customer base and a reflection of the confidence GCB has in the economy and financial market of Nanumba and adjoining districts and communities adding that &quot;it is also in recognition of the key role Nanumba plays in this fast-developing region and the national economy.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;He said the Bank offers a wide range of products and services including GCB's 24 Hour Personal Loan, ATMs (ReadyCash), SMS Banking and Internet Banking among others.&lt;br /&gt;He explained that the 24-HR Personal Loan targets individual customers with a regular source of income and GCB SMS Banking provides customers access to their account information through their cell phones. SMS-Banking has also made it easy for GCB customers to check their balance and transfer funds as well as avoid almost all inconveniences associated with transacting business in a banking hall.&lt;/p&gt;
